# Application for ML Architect Engineer at Munich (ID 47288) or Junior position

Dear ARR team,

- Why gaming + ML is an excellent fit
Utilizing neural networks in a rendering context already yields stunning results, yet there is so much more to explore.
Deep Learning based Super Resolution networks produce excellent image quality in real-time.
Your paper about [neural texture compression](LINK!!) is a promising idea to reduce VRAM usage.
[Game'N'Gen](https://gamengen.github.io/) does this and that...

- Godot FSR 2 implementation
- working methodical -> paper CoG!
- studied Games Engineering -> made small game engine with C++ with with Frameworks/Libaries including OpenGL and Box2D, used CMake
For my bachelor I was curious about the art of games engineering.
I learned the basics of real-time interactive systems and rendering while creating my own small game engine with C++, OpenGL and CMake among other projects.
In my master I combined this interest with machine learning, as I investigated real-time rendering super resolution for my thesis.
I collected my own dataset within Unreal Engine 5 to design and implement a network architecture with Python/Pytorch. My network increases the resolution from 1080p to 4k 60 times a second, while increasing the image quality, e.g. mitigating aliasing.
While I was lucky to have skilled people regarind super resolution around me,
I am still lacking experience.
I want to foster my knowledge regarind rendering techniques in particular neural rendering to support game development.
- focused my master on machine learning
- combined both fields in my master thesis Real-Time Rendering SR 
- used Python + Pytorch 
- was lucky to have skilled people around me

- link job desc, 
I think your position [ML Architect Engineer](LINK!!!) is an excellent oppurtinity for me to grow.
Yet, I feel my experience is not sufficient for a leading role.
Would you consider to hire me for a junior position?
- while I learned a lot and worked my way into this field, my expierence and qualifications are not sufficient for the ML Architect Engineer role.
- Would you consider me in a Junior position?

Best,
Tobias Brandner
