My academic journey has equipped me with a deep understanding of artificial intelligence 
and real-time systems. As part of my master’s thesis, 
I developed a neural network approach for real-time rendering super-resolution —a key technique in computer vision— using Unreal Engine 5. 
This research combined my passion for cutting-edge technology with hands-on problem-solving, 
resulting in a methodology applicable to both industry and academia.
