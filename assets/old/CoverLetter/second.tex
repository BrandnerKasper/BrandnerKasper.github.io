Next to my studies I contributed to innovative research projects and taught courses about real-time systems
at my university. 
These roles honed my ability to collaborate across disciplines, explain complex concepts, 
and deliver results under tight deadlines. 
Additionally, I presented my own work at
the IEEE Conference on Games in Milan, analyzing correlations of movement parameters in 3D
jump’n’run games.
