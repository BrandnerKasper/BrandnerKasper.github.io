While I have yet to work directly with D3D12 or write HIP code, 
I am keen to expand my skills in this area and learn more about neural texture block compression 
and other advanced rendering techniques at AMD. 
I am confident that my technical foundation and enthusiasm for neural rendering align 
well with the goals of your team.
