While I have not yet worked directly with DirectX 12, Vulkan, or Qt, 
I am enthusiastic about expanding my skill set in these areas and 
learning more about cutting-edge engine development techniques for FPS games. 
I am confident that my technical foundation, dedication, and enthusiasm for 
game development align well with your teamâ€™s mission.
