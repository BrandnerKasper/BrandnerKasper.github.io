While I have limited experience in shading languages like HLSL,
I am highly motivated and quick to learn. 
My solid technical foundation in C++, game development, and applied machine learning — 
along with my curiosity about rendering — will enable me to quickly gain
 proficiency and contribute to Keen Games' 3D graphics team.
