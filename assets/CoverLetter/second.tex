In addition to machine learning, my experience 
includes programming in C++ and CMake, 
which I used to build a custom game engine during my bachelorâ€™s degree. 
I tutored courses in game engine development with OpenGL and C++, 
helping new students understand rendering fundamentals, 
and strengthening my technical communication skills. 
My recent work with movement behavior analysis in 3D games also led to a publication 
at the IEEE Conference on Games in Milan this year, 
where I shared insights on movement visualization in jump'n'run environments.
