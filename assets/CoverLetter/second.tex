For my Master’s degree, 
I specialized in artificial intelligence, 
merging this focus with my love for game engines in my thesis project. 
I developed a neural network for real-time rendering super-resolution, 
designed to enhance frame rates and resolution for high-demand games utilizing geometry buffer information. 
This experience taught me valuable lessons about integrating machine learning with real-time interactive systems, 
a skill that I believe could be valuable for the goals at id Software.
In addition, I have worked on various game projects, 
including Abyssal Enigma, a first-person deep-sea exploration game where I managed animations 
and implemented gameplay mechanics, 
and Boss’n Run, a 3D jump’n’run demo focused on analyzing and visualizing movement behavior. 
This work led to a publication at the IEEE Conference on Games in Milan this year, where I presented my findings.
