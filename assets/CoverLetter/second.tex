For my Master’s degree, 
I specialized in artificial intelligence, 
merging this with my passion for graphics in my thesis project. 
I developed a neural network for real-time rendering super-resolution, 
which significantly enhanced resolution, framerate, and quality of rendered content. 
This project taught me valuable lessons in integrating machine learning with 
real-time rendering — a skill that I believe could be beneficial for Keen Games’ 
ambitious projects.

In addition, I have contributed to various student game projects, 
including Abyssal Enigma, a first-person deep-sea exploration game. 
In this project, I implemented player character animations, particle effects, 
and gameplay logic, and later adapted the game to VR, 
incorporating anti-motion sickness techniques like vignettes and virtual nose effects. 
Another project, Boss’n Run, is a 3D jump-n-run demo focused on analyzing and 
replicating movement behaviors of iconic games such as Super Mario 64. 
This work led to the publication “Analysis and Generation of Flow in 3D Jump-n-Run Games,”
 which I presented at the IEEE Conference on Games in Milan this year.
