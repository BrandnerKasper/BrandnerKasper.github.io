For my Master’s degree, 
I specialized in artificial intelligence, 
merging this focus with my love for graphics in my thesis project. 
I developed a neural network for real-time rendering super-resolution, 
which enhanced resolution, framerate, and quality, contributing to a smoother user experience. 
This project taught me valuable lessons in integrating machine learning with 
real-time systems—a skill that I believe would bring unique value to Mapbox’s work in 
advancing 3D visualization and interactivity. 
Additionally, my coursework and projects allowed me to build strong version control practices 
and task management skills, supported by a structured, analytical approach to problem-solving. 
My best grade in “Computational Geometry” and my published research, 
“Analysis and Generation of Flow in 3D Jump’n’Run Games,” 
which I presented at the Conference on Games in Milan, 
demonstrate my commitment to rigorous, methodical work.
