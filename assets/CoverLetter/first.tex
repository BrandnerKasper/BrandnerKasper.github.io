In my Bachelorâ€™s studies, 
I built a game engine from scratch using C++ and OpenGL, 
gaining hands-on experience in rendering fundamentals and memory management. 
This project deepened my passion for real-time systems and 
led me to tutor a game engine development course, 
where I developed strong technical communication skills by helping other students 
understand rendering concepts.
