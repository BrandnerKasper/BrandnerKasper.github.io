As part of my Masterâ€™s thesis, I developed a neural network for real-time super-resolution, 
addressing issues of frame rate and resolution in games with high computational demands. 
Using Python and Pytorch, I created a dataset within Unreal Engine 5 and built a model 
that upscales from 1080p to 4K in real-time, achieving improved visual quality and performance metrics. 
This work taught me valuable lessons in optimizing GPU resources and balancing computational demands, 
which I see as highly relevant to AMD's innovations.
