In my Bachelorâ€™s studies, I built a game engine from scratch using C++ and OpenGL, 
gaining firsthand experience in rendering fundamentals and high-performance graphics. 
This project solidified my passion for real-time interactive systems and 
led me to tutor a game engine development course, 
where I honed my technical communication skills by 
helping new students grasp core rendering concepts.
