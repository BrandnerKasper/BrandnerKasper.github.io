In my Bachelorâ€™s studies, I built a solid foundation in games engineering, 
learning skills that ranged from gameplay programming and plugin development to constructing 
a game engine from scratch using C++ and OpenGL. 
Although working on a game engine was both challenging and rewarding, 
it solidified my passion for the intricate world of real-time interactive systems. 
Recognizing the complexity and value of this area, 
I chose to tutor a course on game engine development at my university. 
Here, I helped new students understand rendering fundamentals while strengthening 
my technical communication skills.
